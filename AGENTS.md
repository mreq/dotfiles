# Agent Instructions

## Python Code Formatting

**MANDATORY**: After editing any Python files, you MUST automatically format them using `black`:

```bash
black <file_path>
```

This ensures consistent code formatting across all Python files in the project.

**IMPORTANT**: Do not skip this step. Formatting must be executed immediately after every Python file edit.

## Bash Script Formatting

**MANDATORY**: After editing any Bash/shell script files, you MUST automatically format them using `shfmt`:

```bash
shfmt -w <file_path>
```

This ensures consistent code formatting across all shell scripts in the project.

**IMPORTANT**: Do not skip this step. Formatting must be executed immediately after every shell script edit.
