# Cursor Rules

## AGENTS.md File Resolution

Before processing any request, automatically check for and read `AGENTS.md` files using the following hierarchical resolution strategy:

1. **Start from the edited file's directory**: If a file is being edited, start searching from that file's directory. Otherwise, start from the current working directory.

2. **Traverse up to project root**: Search for `AGENTS.md` files by traversing up the directory tree from the starting directory all the way to the project root.

3. **Collect all found files**: Gather all `AGENTS.md` files found during traversal.

4. **Apply with precedence**: Files closer to the edited file (or starting directory) take precedence over files further away. When multiple `AGENTS.md` files contain conflicting instructions, the closer file's instructions override the more distant file's instructions.

5. **Read and apply**: Read all collected `AGENTS.md` files in order from closest to furthest, and apply their instructions accordingly.

## Example
If editing `/home/user/project/src/components/Button.tsx`:
- Check for `AGENTS.md` in: `src/components/` → `src/` → project root
- If found at all three levels, apply them with `src/components/AGENTS.md` having highest precedence, then `src/AGENTS.md`, then root `AGENTS.md`

This allows for project-wide rules at the root level, with more specific overrides in subdirectories.
